            The Barbie logo was created by Mattel Creations founders Elliot and Ruth Handler in 1959 when the “Barbie Doll” was created. 
            <br><br>
            Mattel Creations co-founder Ruth Handler opted to design the doll after watching her daughter enjoy playing with paper dolls. After considering a number of designs and ideas, Ruth was finally inspired by a German doll named Bild Lilli, and Barbie was born on the 9th of March 1959. The first Barbie logo was written in a sans serif font when first introduced.
            <br><br>
            The popularity of the Barbie Doll has steadily grown, greatly aided by the logo. Even today, no matter the competition out there, it’s many people’s favorite print. <br><br>

            The Barbie logo is bright pink. This signature color was picked mostly to attract lasses to the Barbie brand. When combined with a typeface that resembles a kid’s handwriting, the logo communicates a sense of childhood, fun, and whimsy. While the Barbie symbol has changed quite a bit since its design in 1959, it has always been bright pink from the get-go.
